# This terraform DataSource is used to query the existing hostgroup from PowerMax array.
# The information fetched from this data source can be used for getting the details / for further processing in resource block.

# Returns all of the PowerMax host groups and their details
data "powermax_hostgroup" "all" {}

output "all" {
  value = data.powermax_hostgroup.all
}

# Returns a subset of the PowerMax host groups based on the names provided in the `names` filter block and their details
data "powermax_hostgroup" "groups" {
  filter {
    # Optional list of names to filter upon
    names = ["host_group_example_1", "host_group_example_2"]
  }
}

output "groups" {
  value = data.powermax_hostgroup.groups
}

# After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output value by executing 'terraform output' command.
# Also, we can use the fetched information by the variable data.powermax_hostgroup.example
