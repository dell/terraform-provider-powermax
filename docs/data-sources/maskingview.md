# powermax_maskingview (Data Source)

Data source for reading Masking Views in PowerMax array. PowerMax masking views are a container of a storage group, a port group, and an initiator group, and makes the storage group visible to the host. Devices are masked and mapped automatically. The groups must contain some device entries.

## Example Usage

```terraform

# After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output value by executing 'terraform output' command.
# Also, we can use the fetched information by the variable data.powermax_maskingview.example
