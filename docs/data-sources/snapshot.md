# powermax_snapshot (Data Source)

Data source for a specific StorageGroup Snapshots in PowerMax array. PowerMax Snaphots is a local replication solution that is designed to nondisruptively create point-in-time copies (snapshots) of critical data.

## Example Usage

```terraform

# This terraform DataSource is used to query the existing snapshot from PowerMax array.
# The information fetched from this data source can be used for getting the details / for further processing in resource block.

# Returns all of the PowerMax snapshots related to a particular storage group and their details
data "powermax_snapshot" "test" {
  # The storage group name to which display all of its snapshots
  # Required
  storage_group {
    name = "example_storage_group"
  }

  # Optional Update the read timeout with (XXm) for minutes or (XXs) for timeout in seconds
  # If unset defaults to 2 minute timeout
  # timeouts = {
  #   read = "3m"
  # }
}

output "powermax_snapshot" {
  value = data.powermax_snapshot.test
}

# After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output value by executing 'terraform output' command.
# Also, we can use the fetched information by the variable data.powermax_snapshot.example

### Nested Schema for `storage_group`

Required:

- `name` (String)


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

- `num_source_volumes` (Number) The number of source volumes in the snapshot generation
- `persistent` (Boolean) Set if this snapshot is persistent.  Only applicable to policy based snapshots
- `secure_expiry_date` (String) When the snapshot will expire once it is not linked
- `snapid` (Number) Unique Snap ID for Snapshot
- `time_to_live_expiry_date` (String) When the snapshot will expire once it is not linked
- `tracks` (Number) The number of source tracks that have been overwritten by the host

Read-Only:

- `expired` (Boolean) Set if this generation secure has expired
- `linked` (Boolean) Set if this generation is SnapVX linked
- `linked_storage_group_names` (List of String) Linked storage group names. Only populated if the generation is linked
- `name` (String) Name of a snapshot
- `num_storage_group_volumes` (Number) The number of non-gatekeeper storage group volumes
- `restored` (Boolean) Set if this generation is SnapVX linked
- `source_volume` (Attributes List) The source volumes of the snapshot generation (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--snapshots--source_volume))
- `state` (List of String) The state of the snapshot generation
- `timestamp` (String) Timestamp of the snapshot generation
- `timestamp_utc` (String) The timestamp of the snapshot generation in milliseconds since 1970

- `linked_volume_name` (String) The linked volumes name
- `name` (String) The storage group name
- `percentage_copied` (Number) Percentage of tracks copied
- `source_volume_name` (String) The source volumes name
