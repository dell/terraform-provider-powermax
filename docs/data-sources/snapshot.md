# powermax_snapshot (Data Source)

Data source for a specific StorageGroup Snapshots in PowerMax array.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "powermax_snapshot" "test" {
  # The storage group to which you want to see all the snapshots
  # Required
  storage_group {
    name = "example_storage_group"
  }
}

output "powermax_snapshot" {
  value = data.powermax_snapshot.test
}
```

- `tracks` (Number) The number of source tracks that have been overwritten by the host

Read-Only:

- `expired` (Boolean) Set if this generation secure has expired
- `linked` (Boolean) Set if this generation is SnapVX linked
- `linked_storage_group_names` (List of String) Linked storage group names. Only populated if the generation is linked
- `name` (String) Name of a snapshot
- `num_storage_group_volumes` (Number) The number of non-gatekeeper storage group volumes
- `restored` (Boolean) Set if this generation is SnapVX linked
- `source_volume` (Attributes List) The source volumes of the snapshot generation (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--snapshots--source_volume))
- `state` (List of String) The state of the snapshot generation
- `timestamp` (String) Timestamp of the snapshot generation
