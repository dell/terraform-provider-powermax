# This terraform DataSource is used to query the existing snapshot_policy from PowerMax array.
# The information fetched from this data source can be used for getting the details / for further processing in resource block.

# Returns all of the PowerMax snapshot policies and their details

  # Optional Update the read timeout with (XXm) for minutes or (XXs) for timeout in seconds
  # If unset defaults to 2 minute timeout
  # timeouts = {
  #   read = "3m"
  # }
}

output "SnapshotPolicyAll" {
  value = data.powermax_snapshotpolicy.SnapshotPolicyAll
}

# Returns a subset of the PowerMax snapshot policies based on the names provided in the `names` filter block and their details

  # Optional Update the read timeout with (XXm) for minutes or (XXs) for timeout in seconds
  # If unset defaults to 2 minute timeout

# After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output value by executing 'terraform output' command.
# Also, we can use the fetched information by the variable data.powermax_snapshotpolicy.example
