# powermax_host (Data Source)

Data source for reading Hosts in PowerMax array. PowerMax hosts systems are storage hosts that use storage system LUN resources. A logical unit number (LUN) is an identifier that is used for labeling and designating subsystems of physical or virtual storage

## Example Usage

```terraform

# This terraform DataSource is used to query the existing host from PowerMax array.
# The information fetched from this data source can be used for getting the details / for further processing in resource block.


# Returns all of the PowerMax hosts and their details

  # Optional Update the read timeout with (XXm) for minutes or (XXs) for timeout in seconds
  # If unset defaults to 2 minute timeout
  # timeouts = {

  value = data.powermax_host.HostDsAll
}

# # Returns a subset of the PowerMax hosts based on the names provided in the `names` filter block and their details

# After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output value by executing 'terraform output' command.
# Also, we can use the fetched information by the variable data.powermax_host.example

## Schema

### Optional

- `filter` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--filter))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `hosts` (Attributes List) List of host attributes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hosts))
- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the host instance.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).


<a id="nestedatt--hosts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `hosts`

Required:

- `host_flags` (Attributes) Flags set for the host. When host_flags = {} then default flags will be considered. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hosts--host_flags))
- `initiator` (List of String) The initiators associated with the host.
- `name` (String) The name of the host.

Optional:

- `consistent_lun` (Boolean) It enables the rejection of any masking operation involving this host that would result in inconsistent LUN values.

Read-Only:

- `bw_limit` (Number) Specifies the bandwidth limit for a host.
- `hostgroup` (List of String) The host group associated with the host.
- `id` (String) The ID of the host.
- `maskingview` (List of String) The masking views associated with the host.
- `num_of_host_groups` (Number) The number of hostgroups associated with the host.
- `num_of_initiators` (Number) The number of initiators associated with the host.
- `num_of_masking_views` (Number) The number of masking views associated with the host.
- `numofpowerpathhosts` (Number) The number of powerpath hosts associated with the host.
- `port_flags_override` (Boolean) States whether port flags override is enabled on the host.
- `powerpathhosts` (List of String) The powerpath hosts associated with the host.
- `type` (String) Specifies the type of host.

### Nested Schema for `hosts.host_flags`

Optional:

- `disable_q_reset_on_ua` (Attributes) It is used for hosts that do not expect the queue to be flushed on a 0629 sense. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hosts--host_flags--disable_q_reset_on_ua))
- `environ_set` (Attributes) It enables the environmental error reporting by the storage system to the host on the specific port. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hosts--host_flags--environ_set))
- `openvms` (Attributes) This attribute enables an Open VMS fibre connection. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hosts--host_flags--openvms))
- `scsi_3` (Attributes) Alters the inquiry data to report that the storage system supports the SCSI-3 protocol. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hosts--host_flags--scsi_3))
