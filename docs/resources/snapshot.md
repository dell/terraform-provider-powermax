- `non_shared_tracks` (Number) The number of tracks uniquely allocated for this snapshots delta. This is an approximate indication of the number of tracks that will be returned to the SRP if this snapshot is terminated.
- `num_source_volumes` (Number) The number of source volumes in the snapshot generation
- `persistent` (Boolean) Set if this snapshot is persistent.  Only applicable to policy based snapshots
- `secure_expiry_date` (String) When the snapshot will expire once it is not linked
- `snapid` (Number) Unique Snap ID for Snapshot
- `snapshot_actions` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--snapshot_actions))
- `storage_group` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--storage_group))
- `time_to_live_expiry_date` (String) When the snapshot will expire once it is not linked

### Read-Only

- `expired` (Boolean) Set if this generation secure has expired
- `id` (String) Identifier
- `linked` (Boolean) Set if this generation is SnapVX linked
- `linked_storage_group_names` (List of String) Linked storage group names. Only populated if the generation is linked
- `name` (String) Name of a snapshot
- `num_storage_group_volumes` (Number) The number of non-gatekeeper storage group volumes

- `state` (List of String) The state of the snapshot generation
- `timestamp` (String) Timestamp of the snapshot generation
- `timestamp_utc` (String) The timestamp of the snapshot generation in milliseconds since 1970

### Nested Schema for `linked_storage_group`

Optional:

- `background_define_in_progress` (Boolean) When the snapshot link is being defined
- `defined` (Boolean) When the snapshot link has been fully defined

Read-Only:
