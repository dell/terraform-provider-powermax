# Available actions: Create, Update (name, host_ids, consistent_lun, host_flags), Delete and Import an existing host group from the PowerMax Array.
# After `terraform apply` of this example file it will create a new host_group with the name set in `name` attribute on the PowerMax

## Schema

### Required

- `host_ids` (Set of String) A list of host ids associated with the hostgroup. (Update Supported)
- `name` (String) The name of the hostgroup. Only alphanumeric characters, underscores ( _ ), and hyphens (-) are allowed. (Update Supported)

### Optional

- `consistent_lun` (Boolean) It enables the rejection of any masking operation involving this hostgroup that would result in inconsistent LUN values. (Update Supported)
- `host_flags` (Attributes) Host Flags set for the hostgroup. When host_flags = {} or not set then default flags will be considered. (Update Supported) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--host_flags))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the hostgroup.
- `maskingviews` (List of String) The masking views associated with the hostgroup.
- `numofhosts` (Number) The number of hosts associated with the hostgroup.
- `numofinitiators` (Number) The number of initiators associated with the hostgroup.
- `numofmaskingviews` (Number) The number of masking views associated with the hostgroup.
- `port_flags_override` (Boolean) States whether port flags override is enabled on the hostgroup.
- `type` (String) Specifies the type of hostgroup.
