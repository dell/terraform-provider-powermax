# powermax_host (Resource)

Resource for managing Host in PowerMax array. PowerMax hosts systems are storage hosts that use storage system LUN resources. A logical unit number (LUN) is an identifier that is used for labeling and designating subsystems of physical or virtual storage

### Optional

- `consistent_lun` (Boolean) It enables the rejection of any masking operation involving this host that would result in inconsistent LUN values. (Update Supported)
- `host_flags` (Attributes) Flags set for the host. When host_flags = {} then default flags will be considered. (Update Supported) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--host_flags))

### Read-Only

- `hostgroup` (List of String) The host group associated with the host.
- `id` (String) The ID of the host.
- `maskingview` (List of String) The masking views associated with the host.
- `num_of_host_groups` (Number) The number of hostgroups associated with the host.
- `num_of_initiators` (Number) The number of initiators associated with the host.
- `num_of_masking_views` (Number) The number of masking views associated with the host.
- `numofpowerpathhosts` (Number) The number of powerpath hosts associated with the host.
- `port_flags_override` (Boolean) States whether port flags override is enabled on the host.
- `powerpathhosts` (List of String) The powerpath hosts associated with the host.
- `type` (String) Specifies the type of host.
