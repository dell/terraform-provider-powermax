# Available actions: Create, Update (vol_name, mobility_id_enabled, size, cap_unit), Delete and Import an existing volume from the PowerMax Array.
# After `terraform apply` of this example file it will create a new volume with the name set in `vol_name` attribute on the PowerMax

  # Attributes which are able to be modified after create (vol_name, mobility_id_enabled, size, cap_unit)

  # Required name of the volume to be created

  # Required size of the volume

  # Possible units are MB, GB, TB, and CYL
